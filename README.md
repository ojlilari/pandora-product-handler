# Pandora â†’ Shopify (Matrixify) Sync

This repository contains a Streamlit application that transforms Pandora master
data into Shopify Matrixify import workbooks. The app follows the canonical
workflow described in the developer manual and produces files for new products,
safe updates, removals, sync reporting, and data quality checks.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas openpyxl
streamlit run pandora_matrixify_streamlit_hardened.py
```

## Usage

1. Launch the app with `streamlit run`.
2. Upload the latest Pandora master Excel file and (optionally) a Shopify export
   generated by Matrixify.
3. Verify or override the column mapping in the sidebar. The app auto-detects
   common header aliases and reconciles manual choices against the actual file
   headers.
4. Configure additional settings, such as the option name for variant products
   or whether Finnish titles should be used as a fallback.
5. Generate the Matrixify workbooks and download individual files or a combined
   ZIP archive.

The primary entry point for the transformation logic and Streamlit UI is
`pandora_matrixify_streamlit_hardened.py`.
